This is a case study for one of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing company based and operating in Chicago. 

The executive team is on the lookout for ways to drive growth and is considering a marketing strategy that aims to convert a large portion of casual riders into members.

As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I've been tasked with presenting to executives my findings and recommendations once I've thoroughly explored, processed and analyzed any relevant data.

You'll find the written report on my data analysis process in the cyclistic-case-study.ipynb file above.
